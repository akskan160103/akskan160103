👋 Hi, I'm Akshay Kannan

🎓 I'm a junior CSE student at the University of Michigan.

🔭 I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, particularly with technologies such as React.js, Node.js, and Express.js

💼 I worked as a SWE intern at First Abu Dhabi Bank from May 2023 - August 2023.

 🚀 My passion lies in creating innovative digital solutions and exploring the intersection of software development and AI. I'm driven by the idea of using technology to expand the realms of what's possible and to make a positive impact.

🌱 I’m continuously learning and striving to improve my coding and development skills.

🤝 I’m excited to collaborate on innovative projects and eager to contribute to exciting ideas in any way I can.
