👋 Hi, I'm Akshay Kannan

🎓 I graduated from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in May 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science.

🔧 I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, working with technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Flask, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. I've also built and deployed scalable cloud infrastructure using AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

💼 I've completed software engineering internships at NSEIT (US), LearningClues, and First Abu Dhabi Bank, where I worked on everything from real-time chatbot APIs and recommendation systems to security automation pipelines.

🚀 I'm passionate about building innovative digital tools and exploring the intersection of software engineering, AI, and real-world impact. I enjoy tackling performance bottlenecks, optimizing backend systems, and writing clean, scalable code.

🌱 I'm always learning—whether it's diving deeper into Python and JavaScript ecosystems or exploring new frameworks, APIs, and system design patterns.

🤝 I'm excited to collaborate on open-source projects or creative engineering challenges. Let’s build something meaningful together.
